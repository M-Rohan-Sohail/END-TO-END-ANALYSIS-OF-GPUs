# END-TO-END-ANALYSIS-OF-GPUs
In This Repo I have Uploaded my Project in Which i have done end to end Analysis of GPUs. This analysis explored trends in GPU manufacturing across top brands like Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA. Key insights focused on release years, memory capacities, and market strategies based on performance tiers.

Insights  

1.2013 Saw the Highest Number of GPU Releases, marking a significant peak in hardware launches.

2.Intel Entered the GPU Market Aggressively, rapidly producing a wide range of high-spec models in a short time span.

3.AMD Leads in Average VRAM Size, surpassing NVIDIA in delivering more memory per GPU on average.

4.VRAM Capacities Have Grown Over the Years, with some modern GPUs reaching up to 288GB, showing strong upward trends in memory advancements.

5.The Majority of GPUs Are Entry-Level, with 1GB VRAM being the most common configuration among released models.

Conclusion

The GPU industry has experienced consistent evolution, with 2013 being a peak year for releases. AMD leads in average VRAM capacity, while Intel has rapidly expanded its lineup. Despite advances, entry-level GPUs with 1GB VRAM still dominate the market, indicating continued demand for budget-friendly solutions alongside high-end innovations.
